Project Title: Data Science Job Salary Prediction Model using Decision Tree and Random Forest

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the salary of a data scientist based on various features such as job title, years of experience, education level, location, etc. The project uses decision tree and random forest algorithms to build the model.

The data science industry is growing rapidly, and employers are looking for ways to attract and retain top talent. One way to do this is to offer competitive salaries based on the experience and skills of the candidates. However, it can be difficult to determine the appropriate salary for a particular candidate based on their qualifications. This project aims to solve this problem by building a machine learning model that can predict the salary of a data scientist based on various features.
